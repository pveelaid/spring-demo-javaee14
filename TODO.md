### Building program steps
- Requirements
  - Business requirements - what application should do
    - Identify initial requirements
    - Work on details of initial requirements
  - Technical requirements - technology stack (which framework/languages should we use)
    - Translation of business requirements into technical ones

### Notes application
    - Business requirements:
        - storing and managing (add/edit) notes
        - adding extra stuff to notes
        - status - (new/in progess/done)
        - remainders about dates

### Steps for adding reservations (JSON)

- controller with endpoint
- service for processing the data
- repository - should save data into database
- database table
- what to send in response to client??
